This project involved developing predictive models using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Stacking, and Voting Classifiers. All models achieved perfect accuracy (1.0) on both test and cross-validation sets, indicating consistent and reliable performance. Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning were key to this success. Recommendations include ensuring data representativeness, exploring more data for validation, and leveraging model interpretability techniques like SHAP. The ensemble methods confirmed robust predictions, suggesting potential for deployment in real-world applications with continuous performance monitoring.
